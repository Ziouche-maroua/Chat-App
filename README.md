# Simple Chat App
This is a basic chat application built using Next.js. Throughout this project, I have learned and implemented a variety of modern web development concepts and technologies, significantly enhancing my skills.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js: A powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
- TypeScript: Adds static type-checking to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
- Redis: Utilized for database management and caching, offering fast data retrieval and storage.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with customizable design elements.
- Kinde: Used for user authentication, streamlining the login and registration process.
- Pusher: Provides real-time capabilities, allowing for instant message delivery and updates.
- Cloudinary: A cloud-based solution for image upload and management.
- shadcn/ui : A modular component library that enhances the UI with great features and animations.

## Future Plans
In the future, I aim to enhance this application by adding features for editing and deleting messages, which will provide users with greater control over their conversations.

Building this chat application has been an incredible journey, allowing me to explore various modern web development technologies and libraries. Each component of this app has taught me valuable lessons and equipped me with the skills to create more complex applications in the future.
